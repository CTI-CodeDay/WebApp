# Bringing Code to Your Machine
[Go back to Readme Home](../../README.md)

## Set up your environment

Make sure you have created a place to put all of the code from Github, for example:

    $ mkdir /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/

## Setting up your repository for work

1. Install and configure git on your local machine if it is not already installed. See instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. Create a fork of wevote/WebApp.git repository. You can do this from https://github.com/wevote/WebApp with the "Fork" button (upper right of screen)

1. Using your terminal program, change directory into the local folder on your computer where you want the WebApp repository to be downloaded (replacing "<YOUR NAME HERE>" with your login name, and <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE> with your github username) and clone your fork:  
  
    `cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/`

    `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE>/WebApp.git`

1. Change into your local WebApp repository folder, and set up a remote for upstream:

    `cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WebApp`

    `$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:wevote/WebApp.git`  

#### Windows machines only

5. Set the line endings to LF in git so ESLint doesn't flag CRLF line endings as errors

    $ git config --global core.autocrlf false

Next, set `* text=auto` in your `.gitattributes` file (you may need to create this file in your root WebApp folder)

    * text=auto

Finally, set the core.eol to LF

    $ git config --global core.eol lf


### Create and set up SSH keys. (For Windows machines, refer to [these instructions instead](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-windows)).

  1. Create SSH key: 
  
     `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@somedomain.com"`
   
  2. Add SSH private keys into the SSH authentication agent:
  
     `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

  3. Copy the contents of the *public* key file into your computer's clipboard:
  
     `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

  4. Go to your "Settings" page in GitHub (click on your avatar on the top right). In the left navigation, choose "SSH and GPG keys".
  
  5. Click the "New SSH key" button on the top right.
  
  6. Paste the contents of the "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" key file (which you just copied in step 3) into the "Key" text area, and give it any Title you would like.
